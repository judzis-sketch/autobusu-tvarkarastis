So I will get one for you. And he set out at once on his own journey. I walked on, and was met by a woman. Here, she said, is an umbrella, for I see from the weather-vane that it is likely to rain. The weather-vane was on the Town Hall. It showed a golden cockerel with his tail blown out in the north wind. I looked about me. It was a beautiful old city, with mellow brick houses and a great many trees, and it stood upon a hill. Down below was a river and a ring of meadows. What do you think of our city? asked the Lord Mayor, stepping from his front door in a red gown trimmed with fur. We are proud of our city, and we mean to take good care of it. Have you noticed our fine new traffic-signs? I could not say that I had. They had not been put up. But I saw that great care was being taken in other matters. The litter-baskets, for instance, were beautiful. They were of a pleasant shape, coloured a modest grey, and lettered in a graceful script which I was told was the work of a student from the Art School. And on them was the simple request PLEASE KEEP YOUR CITY TIDY. I must own that I could see no litter. It may be that the litter-baskets were so beautiful that people came from far and near to put their litter in them. There were a great many people walking about, and they were all so considerate that they made way for me on the pavement. I was a stranger there, but they could not have been kinder. On the day I left, I went to say good-bye to the Lord Mayor. Thank you for all you have done for me, I said. We have done nothing, he replied. Come and see us again when our traffic-signs are up. So I took a last look at the golden cockerel, and went upon my way.
A great pity, you say. A great pity that this city is not a real city. But it could be. We have the skill and the men and the money. The will is all that we lack. What is wrong with our will? You have only to look about you to see that. We spend our money on the wrong things. Not on litter-baskets, which are cheap, but on motorways, which are expensive. We spend it on high-rise flats when we could have houses-and-gardens. We spend it on municipal buildings that are an offence to the eye. We spend it on a hundred-and-one things that add nothing to the grace of our living. Why? Because we have been told that these things are ‘necessary'. They are not. They are only the product of a false philosophy of life.
You can see for yourself how this philosophy is at work. It has given us the affluent society, as we like to call it, but it has not given us the good life. The motor-car, which should be the servant of man, has become his master. We make way for it on the pavement. We give up our houses and gardens for it. We fill our lungs with its foul breath. And we do these things not because we must, but because we have been told that we must.
We have been told that we must have motorways. But must we? A motorway is a very expensive way of getting from one place to another. It is also a very dangerous way. It is a way that destroys the countryside. And it is a way that is open only to those who have cars. The rest of us must make do with the old roads. Or we must walk.
You may say that we have no choice. You may say that the motor-car is here to stay, and that we must learn to live with it. I do not agree. I think that we have a choice. I think that we can choose to live in a different way. We can choose to live in cities that are designed for people, not for cars. We can choose to live in a society where the good life is more important than the affluent life.
It is a choice that we must make soon. For if we do not, we shall find that we have lost the battle. We shall find that we have become the slaves of the machine. And we shall find that we have lost the one thing that makes life worth living. The beauty of our cities and our countryside.
A choice between the quick and the dead. The quick are the cars. The dead are the people.
I think that we should choose the people. But it is a choice that we must make together. And it is a choice that we must make now.

You can see for yourself how this philosophy is at work. It has given us the affluent society, as we like to call it, but it has not given us the good life. The motor-car, which should be the servant of man, has become his master. We make way for it on the pavement. We give up our houses and gardens for it. We fill our lungs with its foul breath. And we do these things not because we must, but because we have been told that we must.
We have been told that we must have motorways. But must we? A motorway is a very expensive way of getting from one place to another. It is also a very dangerous way. It is a way that destroys the countryside. And it is a way that is open only to those who have cars. The rest of us must make do with the old roads. Or we must walk.
You may say that we have no choice. You may say that the motor-car is here to stay, and that we must learn to live with it. I do not agree. I think that we have a choice. I think that we can choose to live in a different way. We can choose to live in cities that are designed for people, not for cars. We can choose to live in a society where the good life is more important than the affluent life.
It is a choice that we must make soon. For if we do not, we shall find that we have lost the battle. We shall find that we have become the slaves of the machine. And we shall find that we have lost the one thing that makes life worth living. The beauty of our cities and our countryside.
A choice between the quick and the dead. The quick are the cars. The dead are the people.
I think that we should choose the people. But it is a choice that we must make together. And it is a choice that we must make now.
I was given a map of a city I had never seen. I was told that I would have no trouble in finding my way about, said a friendly person, but a map will certainly help. So I will get one for you. And he set out at once on his own journey. I walked on, and was met by a woman. Here, she said, is an umbrella, for I see from the weather-vane that it is likely to rain. The weather-vane was on the Town Hall. It showed a golden cockerel with his tail blown out in the north wind. I looked about me. It was a beautiful old city, with mellow brick houses and a great many trees, and it stood upon a hill. Down below was a river and a ring of meadows. What do you think of our city? asked the Lord Mayor, stepping from his front door in a red gown trimmed with fur. We are proud of our city, and we mean to take good care of it. Have you noticed our fine new traffic-signs? I could not say that I had. They had not been put up. But I saw that great care was being taken in other matters. The litter-baskets, for instance, were beautiful. They were of a pleasant shape, coloured a modest grey, and lettered in a graceful script which I was told was the work of a student from the Art School. And on them was the simple request PLEASE KEEP YOUR CITY TIDY. I must own that I could see no litter. It may be that the litter-baskets were so beautiful that people came from far and near to put their litter in them. There were a great many people walking about, and they were all so considerate that they made way for me on the pavement. I was a stranger there, but they could not have been kinder. On the day I left, I went to say good-bye to the Lord Mayor. Thank you for all you have done for me, I said. We have done nothing, he replied. Come and see us again when our traffic-signs are up. So I took a last look at the golden cockerel, and went upon my way.
A great pity, you say. A great pity that this city is not a real city. But it could be. We have the skill and the men and the money. The will is all that we lack. What is wrong with our will? You have only to look about you to see that. We spend our money on the wrong things. Not on litter-baskets, which are cheap, but on motorways, which are expensive. We spend it on high-rise flats when we could have houses-and-gardens. We spend it on municipal buildings that are an offence to the eye. We spend it on a hundred-and-one things that add nothing to the grace of our living. Why? Because we have been told that these things are ‘necessary'. They are not. They are only the product of a false philosophy of life.

Have you noticed our fine new traffic-signs? I could not say that I had. They had not been put up. But I saw that great care was being taken in other matters. The litter-baskets, for instance, were beautiful. They were of a pleasant shape, coloured a modest grey, and lettered in a graceful script which I was told was the work of a student from the Art School. And on them was the simple request PLEASE KEEP YOUR CITY TIDY. I must own that I could see no litter. It may be that the litter-baskets were so beautiful that people came from far and near to put their litter in them. There were a great many people walking about, and they were all so considerate that they made way for me on the pavement. I was a stranger there, but they could not have been kinder. On the day I left, I went to say good-bye to the Lord Mayor. Thank you for all you have done for me, I said. We have done nothing, he replied. Come and see us again when our traffic-signs are up. So I took a last look at the golden cockerel, and went upon my way.
A great pity, you say. A great pity that this city is not a real city. But it could be. We have the skill and the men and the money. The will is all that we lack. What is wrong with our will? You have only to look about you to see that. We spend our money on the wrong things. Not on litter-baskets, which are cheap, but on motorways, which are expensive. We spend it on high-rise flats when we could have houses-and-gardens. We spend it on municipal buildings that are an offence to the eye. We spend it on a hundred-and-one things that add nothing to the grace of our living. Why? Because we have been told that these things are ‘necessary'. They are not. They are only the product of a false philosophy of life.
You can see for yourself how this philosophy is at work. It has given us the affluent society, as we like to call it, but it has not given us the good life. The motor-car, which should be the servant of man, has become his master. We make way for it on the pavement. We give up our houses and gardens for it. We fill our lungs with its foul breath.
